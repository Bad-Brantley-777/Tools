Building
--------

* GNU C++ compiler:

  If you have installed liblcf, you can use pkg-config to figure out
  the needed flags and paths. Compile with:
  g++ src/main.cpp `pkg-config --cflags --libs liblcf` -o lcf2xml

  Otherwise you need to download/git-clone and compile liblcf first
  and have to make sure it can be found by the compiler, for example
  by exporting a shell variable:
  LLCF=/path/to/liblcf/src

  Then you can compile with:
  g++ -I$LLCF -I$LLCF/generated src/main.cpp -L$LLCF -llcf -lexpat \
    -o lcf2xml

* Visual Studio method:

  Read the lib/README file then open the .sln file in builds/ folder.
